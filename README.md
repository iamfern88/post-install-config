In order to start installing the osTicket system I have to create a Virtual Machine. Once we created a VM we are going to log into the VM with Remote Desktop were I can start downloading the post installments that we need to start our own osTicket system. The VM its self runs its own operating system it can also run windows inside a mac.

This is the Remote Desktop were I can log into to have access to the VM were I can start downloading the installments for osTicket. This also helps me work in a windows setting and also be able to connect to a server to do some activities.

This is the Internet Information Services also called (IIS). IIS is going to keep everything organized, makes sure the osTicket system stays up, and lets you run the apps you need. Its going to keep your website stable while using the programs you've installed.
